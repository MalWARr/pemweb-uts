            <h1>The Self-Taught Programmer: The Definitive Guide to Programming Professionally</h1>
            <p class="author">Cory Althoff</p>
            <p class="description">I am a self-taught programmer. After a year of self-study, I learned to program well enough to land a job as a software engineer II at eBay. Once I got there, I realized I was severely under-prepared. I was overwhelmed by the amount of things I needed to know but hadn't learned yet. My journey learning to program, and my experience at my first job as a software engineer were the inspiration for this book.</p>
            <p>This book is not just about learning to program; although you will learn to code. If you want to program professionally, it is not enough to learn to code; that is why, in addition to helping you learn to program, I also cover the rest of the things you need to know to program professionally that classes and books don't teach you. "The Self-Taught Programmer" is a roadmap, a guide to take you from writing your first Python program to passing your first technical interview. I divided this book into five sections:</p>
            <ol class="sections">
                <li>Start to program in Python 3 and build your first program.</li>
                <li>Learn Object-Oriented Programming and create a powerful Python program to get you hooked.</li>
                <li>Learn to use tools like Git, Bash, and regular expressions. Then use your new coding skills to build a web scraper.</li>
                <li>Study Computer Science fundamentals like data structures and algorithms.</li>
                <li>Finish with tips for working with a team and landing a programming job.</li>
            </ol>
